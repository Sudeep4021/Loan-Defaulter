**Summary**

So After changing threshold values we came to an end. And
0.7 or 70 percent is good enough to predict.

**Good Loans**
1. Anything above 70 percent probability - Approve

**Bad Loans**
2. Anything below 60 percent probability - Reject

**Manual Check**
3. The remaining 60 - 70  percent we should manually check.
